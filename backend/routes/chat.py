        return 'Phosphorus promotes strong root development and flowering. Deficiency shows as purple leaf discoloration and poor root systems. Recommended sources: triple superphosphate (0-46-0), bone meal, or rock phosphate. Apply before planting for root establishment.'
    
    elif 'potassium' in message_lower:
        return 'Potassium enhances disease resistance and water regulation. Low levels cause leaf edge burning and weak stems. Use muriate of potash (0-0-60), potassium sulfate, or wood ash. Essential during fruit development and stress periods.'

        return 'Fall activities: Plant cover crops to protect soil, add organic matter, collect soil samples for testing, clean up crop residues, and plan next year\'s garden layout. Fall is ideal for soil amendments.'
    
    # General farming advice
    elif 'organic' in message_lower:
